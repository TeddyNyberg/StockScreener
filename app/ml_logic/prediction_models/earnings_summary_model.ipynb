      "Alison Cahill Lubert -- Vice President Corporate Communications\n",
      "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are discussing Green Dot's third quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Following remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Our most recent earnings release that accompanies this call and webcast can be found at ir.greendot.com. As a reminder, our comments may include forward-looking statements and expectations regarding future results and performance. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in Green Dot's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\n",
      "During the call, we'll make reference to our financial measures that do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles. For the sake of forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll make reference to our financial measures that do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles for the sake of clarity, presented by other companies.

      "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dan.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Thank you, Ali. Welcome, everyone, to Green Dot's Q3 2020 Earnings Call. It's been a busy and productive few months since we last gathered. We are pleased to report a better-than-expected third quarter, which we attribute to a number of factors, including our continued work to drive efficiencies and lower cost and increased demand for our products across our consumer, retail and B2B offerings. We remain focused on unlocking new opportunities and capitalizing on the accelerated shift from cash to digital banking and payments which was further eliminated by the pandemic and other dynamics taking place in the marketplace. As we end, we are already seeing benefits from our work-from-anywhere initiative from both a cost savings and talent recruitment perspective. In a few minutes, I'll pass it over to Jess to walk you through the details of our financial results, but I'd like to start by sharing a few highlights and my perspective on what contributed to a solid third quarter. I'm going to focus on three key areas of progress to stem back to the objectives I laid out earlier this year.\n",
      "These will include improving our financial performance and execution, refocusing and enhancing our bass strategy and launching our new and lasting challenger bank initiative. While Jeff will cover the financial performance in detail, let me provide you with my take on the results for the quarter. Non-GAAP revenue increased 22% compared with the third quarter of the prior year. This higher revenue was driven by a combination of new and existing customers using Green Dot products to electronically receive your income, elevated deposit balances from stimulus funds received in Q2, growth in our BaaS partner fees and accelerated demand for digital banking and payments products. We also started to see recovery in areas of our business that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Our total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 increased by $42 million compared to the third quarter of the prior year, and our margins expanded by approximately 100 basis points. A big component of the increase in operating expenses was related to growth of our BaaS business.\n",
      "We also had lower marketing expenses in the quarter. If you recall, Green Dot spent a majority of its full 2019 marketing budget in the second half of 2019. Finally, we had a few headwinds to margins, especially and increased revenue share with one of our key retail partners, higher transaction losses on our purchase volume and the timing-related expenses associated with incentive compensation for our employees. Moving on to our BaaS business. As we previously announced, we officially kicked off new relationships with Intuit and Kabbage in the third quarter, which further positions Green Dot to serve and Empower America's 30 million plus small businesses and entrepreneurs. Leveraging Green Dot's capabilities into it announced their plans to launch a QuickBooks cash account and Kabbage announced plans for Kabbage checking. We're also very excited about Kabbage's accelerated potential now that there are parts of American Express. Through these products, small business owners will now have access to more seamless, safe and value-driven banking and cash management for their businesses. We're incredibly proud to be a part of this movement, and look forward to deepening our partnerships with Intuit and Kabbage and doing more for small businesses in the future. We believe the opportunity for Green Dot to offer its services to the vast SMB segment is immense, and we look forward to providing you with more updates regarding this opportunity.\n",
      "On that note, you may have seen an exciting announcement last week about a new strategic investment and partnership with Gig Wage, which for those who may not be familiar, is a very impressive and fast-growing start-up, focused on creating a better financial ecosystem for the rapidly expanding gig economy. I met Gig Wage's founder Craig lewis, earlier this year, it quickly became clear that we have similar goals and visions for the industry and for our customers and that we could do a lot together. Green Dot Led Gig Wage's Series A funding round, and we will serve as their infrastructure bank partner, enabling Gig Wage to launch a number of new financial solutions designed for 1,099 workers and their employers. As a strategic investor and BaaS partner, Green Dot has an exciting opportunity to grow this vertical and capitalize on the growing demand for better banking and payment solutions for the Gig economy. Also, we have a few new partners we will be announcing soon. Brands that everyone will know and recognize. One thing I want to reiterate is our commitment to partnering with Select high-impact and high-potential companies, meaning they are highly respected brands with very impressive reach or their start-ups with tremendous potential, which we will differentiate ourselves as a BaaS provider by acting, not just as a bank sponsorship, but also a true partner, providing end-to-end support, spanning technology, program management, call center support, fraud and our retail network and more.\n",
      "Which we consider a huge differentiator of Green Dot. Last but certainly not least, one of the most important and exciting areas of focus and progress has been unlocking our potential as a powerful challenger bank. Earlier this year, one of the goals I set for the company was to introduce a new direct-to-consumer bank, and that vision will come to fruition very soon. Last week, we officially launched our wait list for go-to bank, which is an entirely new and simplified digital banking experience that will offer meaningful value and features designed to save people time and money and manage and move money effortlessly. We chose go-to bank as our new brand by doing some pretty extensive research and because we want this product to be the go-to destination for modern banking and money movement for everyone wherever they go. Go-to will be a solution designed primarily for low to moderate-income consumers who are looking for and can benefit from a better way to bank and transact. And we plan to expand the target market as we enhance the product features and services over time.\n",
      "As one of the only challenger banks to actually be a bank, Go-to bank will position Green Dot to compete aggressively and profitably. When we launch early next year, Go-to will offer a compelling value proposition to a wide range of customers, including the security and protection that comes with a member FDIC bank, an intuitive mobile app and experience where you can quickly set up and manage your account, no monthly fees when we use direct deposit, free in network ATMs, 10 times national average API and other valuable features and rewards. And our plan is to expand on those features quickly. This new brand and product set represent a meaningful and long-term commitment and strategy for Green Dot. So you can expect to see a lot more of this in 2021 and beyond. While we intend to spend to develop the Go-to bank brand and acquire customers, our marketing dollars will be based on a data-driven marketing strategy driven by thoughtful and rigorous return on investment requirements and expectations for lifetime value. Green Dot has a proud 20-year history of serving over 33 million customers through our retail direct-to-consumer products and many more through our banking partners like Walmart, Apple, Uber and other well-known innovative brands.\n",
      "We know how to build products that make money movement and access more seamless, intuitive and safe for everyone. We also know there is a significant segment of our population that continues to be underserved by the financial services industry, and we have the opportunity to change that with Go-to bank. I encourage you to visit Go-to-bank.com and join our wait list. As you may be able to tell, we have been incredibly busy laying the foundation to deliver value-added products and services to our customers, directly as well as through our valuable BaaS partners. At the same time, we are delivering on our commitment to rightsize the cost structure and establish sustainable operating leverage, which will create value to you, our shareholders. I would like to thank our valuable employees who have been working tirelessly through these challenging times.\n",
      "And with that, I'll pass it over to Jess to walk through our numbers.\n",
      "Jess Unruh -- Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer\n",
      "Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone. Overall, Green Dot had strong financial results in the quarter and significantly exceeded our internal expectations from three months ago. The momentum we saw in Q2 from stimulus funds, unemployment benefits, and new users on the platform carried into Q3. We are pleased that the scale of our platform and our market reach puts us in a position to benefit from the accelerated adoption of digital payments. Our Q3 2020 non-GAAP revenue grew 22% to $279 million, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $34 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.25. We experienced a few significant tailwinds as well as headwinds in the quarter that I'll walk you through. Overall, we were pleased with the strength of the consolidated performance. Focusing on our top line results for a moment, non-GAAP revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by our account programs, with strong performance in key metrics such as account acquisition, gross dollar volume and purchase volume.\n",
      "The growth in gross dollar volume was driven in part by the extension of federal unemployment benefits and higher levels of tax refund deposits onto our account programs due to the extension of the tax filing deadlines to July 2020. Altogether, this resulted in increased management service fees from our BaaS partners, increased monthly maintenance fees from elevated deposit balances and growth in interchange revenue. Consistent with the previous quarter, the interchange rate we earned was down year-over-year in Q3 due to a 30% increase in the average ticket size per transaction. Since interchange fees have both fixed and variable components, we earned smaller fees in percentage terms on larger transactions, partially offsetting the increase in revenue in our account segment was an increase in cash rewards related to Green Dot unlimited accounts. We also experienced revenue growth in our money movement services, primarily due to a 9% growth in the number of cash transfers, a significant growth in tax refunds processed from the shift in the tax filing deadline and continued growth in new tax processing services we introduced this year.\n",
      "Partially offsetting this growth was a year-over-year decline in simply paid disbursement transactions as a result of the disruption in the ridesharing business from the effects of COVID-19. Another headwind discussed on prior calls was the year-over-year decline in net interest income due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances as a result of rate cuts by the Federal reserve earlier this year. Let me turn my attention to our expenses and margins. Our total non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 grew by $42 million or 20% year-over-year, and our margins expanded approximately 100 basis points. Sales and marketing expenses declined by 5% due to lower marketing expenses year-over-year. Our marketing spend in 2019 was heavily concentrated in the back half of the year, whereas we are spreading the spend more evenly across 2020. The lower marketing expense was partially offset by an increase in revenue share with our partners, including an increased revenue share rate associated with last year's renewal of the Walmart Moneycard program. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 18% due to incentive compensation for our employees. Consistent with our commentary on our prior earnings call, we've reinvested some of our planned SG&A saves to incentivize and reward our nonexecutive employees for their extraordinary efforts to serve our customers and execute on our priorities as we navigate through the pandemic. Processing expenses increased 60%, in line with corresponding revenue increase in our BaaS fees and interchange revenue.\n",
      "Other general and administrative expenses increased to 43%, mainly as a result of an increase in transactional losses from higher volumes of customer disputes. In Q2, we experienced a significant increase in transaction losses primarily due to operational disruptions caused by COVID-19. In Q3 and likely for the remainder of this year, the basis points of loss on transactions will be a headwind to margins as we continue to work diligently on improving the customer experience and align our fraud prevention processes with the industry's best practices and performance. We expect loss rates will begin to normalize in 2021. Depreciation expense in Q3 increased to 15% year-over-year due to increased capitalization development costs over the past several years to support our strategic initiatives. We expect depreciation expense to increase in the short-term and then begin to flatten out as we reduced the level of overall spend on development by consolidating some of our products and focusing on prioritizing our development based on strategic impact and incremental operating margins. From a liquidity perspective, we generated $37 million of operating cash flow during Q3 and $199 million year-to-date. Our cash at the holding company at quarter end was $152 million. The $100 million revolver is available to us should be needed to invest in strategic initiatives. Now I'd like to focus on expectations for the remainder of the year. As we look ahead, while our business remains very healthy, it is important to remember that Q2 benefited from approximately $2 billion of gross dollar volume from stimulus funds and Q3 had a follow-on benefit from elevated deposits.\n",
      "Additionally, Q2 and Q3, in aggregate, benefited from approximately $2 billion of incremental federal unemployment benefits afforded under the Cares Act. While we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the accelerated adoption of digital payments, we expect our KPIs to continue to normalize that stimulus disbursements roll off and the enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. While each of account acquisition, gross dollar volume and purchase volume were in Q3, above long-term historical trends, we do anticipate that normalization will occur throughout Q4 2020. One item to note for Q4 is that we expect a year-over-year decline in cash transfers. We decided to not renew an agreement with a large reload partner because of proposed renewal terms and associated margins did not meet our expectations. Thus, our cash transfer volumes and the related topline revenue will be impacted.\n",
      "But given the lower profitability of this contract, we actually expect the overall percentage contribution margin in our money processing channel to improve. As we think about the full year 2020, we expect our non-GAAP revenues will be in the range of $1.175 billion to $1.185 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $195 million to $200 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2. These ranges do not anticipate another significant federal stimulus program nor do they anticipate a further economic slowdown from the impact of COVID-19. In conclusion, we remain focused on reducing the overall complexity of our operations with the goal of generating consistent operating leverage in the years to come. We believe decisions made this year will begin to benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Speaking of 2021, we expect to provide formal guidance for the year when we report our Q4 2020 results in February. While we're still in our budget process, we would like to provide some insights for you to consider as you build your models. First, we will have positive impact from initiatives discussed earlier, including new BaaS partnerships and Go-to bank as well as various costs and capital efficiencies. We will also have year-over-year headwinds associated with the government benefits that positively impacted our 2020 results, as we discussed earlier. We look forward to providing a more detailed discussion on our next earnings call.\n",

      "Questions and Answers:\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Robert Paul Napoli -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\n",
      "Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob. Lot going on. Just maybe a first question, just on direct deposit. And I mean the -- your prior roles. I mean, direct deposit was a big focus. I know it's a big focus here. The penetration rate currently is about 40% on direct deposit accounts. Is there a strategy around building the direct deposit customer base at a faster rate? If so, what is it and what kind of a penetration rate or other metrics would you judge with the success of that program on?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes, Bob, I think your question, I think, illustrates the knowledge and awareness of like from what we do. The direct deposit customer is extremely valuable customer. So as we -- when we launch our challenger Bank initiative early next year, we will be very focused on driving that direct deposit growth with that product. So in terms of any sort of metrics or levels of success, can't give those to you at this point? But yes, it's going to be a cornerstone to our strategy and our focus on growth.\n",
      "Robert Paul Napoli -- William Blair & Company -- Analyst\n",
      "Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, the new partners, it sounds like you have a pipeline of new large and small partners, as you mentioned, start ups and well-known brands. Is there a different approach to those new partners versus what Green Dot has had in the past or is it more partnership as we view? And would this generate higher ROIs maybe than some of the partnerships in the past?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "No. The approach file is different. And I don't know what was shared publicly, but from my understanding is or my approach is very much of a quality instead of a quantity in terms of partners. And if you think about what we have at Green Dot, we have a very unique collection of assets. I mean I'll say right now, I don't like the bath acronym for us because we do a lot more than just give access to our bin, so I think banking as a service. We can bring to our partners -- our partnerships a bank. We can bring logistic expertise in terms of insulin plastic. We've got a tech stack. We have a reload network. We have customer service call centers, management expertise. We've got fraud management expertise. So we bring a whole collection of services. And so our new approach is not to just let any fintech come along and kind of take us one piece at a time of our service, but more look for large partners, like many of the ones we have that are looking for kind of an all-encompassing solution and relationship, work to deepen that relationship and bring powerful products and solutions that really nobody else can offer because nobody else has a collection of the assets we have, bring those to large partners who can really drive scale for us in adoption of the masses with those solutions. And then on the other side of the spectrum, more partnerships with companies like Gig Wage. It's -- Craig, Lewis, the CEO of that and founder of that business, he's a tremendous entrepreneur, a hard charging. He's built a great low platform. He's got some great prospects in terms of a growing wave of the Gig economy. And we want to play in that, and we see being able to invest in a company like Gig Wage, truly be their partner and help them grow and grow with them in the Gig economy. That's the strategy we want to do on our partner approach. So as I said, what I just read is it's either large partners with tremendous reach, are small, very powerful partners with tremendous growth potential.\n",

      "The next question comes from George Sutton of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\n",
      "George Frederick Sutton -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst\n",
      "Congratulations to me. I'm the latest wake less customer for the new Challenger Bank offering. So I\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Go to bank. We will be your go to bank for all your seamless and frictionless financial services. So glad to have you on board.\n",
      "George Frederick Sutton -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst\n",
      "If you can handle all my wife needs, very impressed. So question competitively. Goldman Sachs just announced entrance into the bass market. Axos had to give up a customer because they had reached two large a size and couldn't work with rev share. I think Goldman will have the same issue. So curious how you're -- and I happy that you're defining some of your capabilities a little bit more specifically. But I'm curious, competitively, when I look at that larger landscape and issues that some might run into. And then look at the sort of some of the bigger opportunities in the space. Just help us understand when you're building up this pipeline how competitive it is. And I would also like to add, and I don't need a follow-up question. So this will be my follow-up question. The renewal deal that you didn't go forward with and how that demonstrates customers you might be moving away from?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Sure. So the renewal we passed on was with a partner that was only using our reload network. And so we -- what we saw there was somebody who was demanding high volume in service with next to no margin, sometimes negative margin, and we were not willing to go there. Especially, as I said, they were just doing an a la carte solution where all they wanted to use was our reload network. So I will walk from that partner. In terms of the other thing, your other question in regards to how we -- as our bank grows with all these new partners, how do we maintain the asset level. Really don't want to get into a lot of detail on that, but other just to share that we're very confident that as we structure our business, Greg Cores, who's now the CEO of our bank. We can run our bank. We can stay below the $10 billion asset level for a long, long time with very significant volume coming across our institution. And if you compare that with, say, a Goldman Sachs bank or whatever banks are out there now jumping on the BaaS wagon. Those banks are entirely different types of banks than we are. Those are traditional financial institutions that do all sorts of banking and lending, and they want to be $300 million, $400 billion in assets. And so that's -- they will have a different issue, and we'll be able to protect our revenue with higher interchange by maintaining our $10 billion or less asset size.\n",

      "Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of Truth Securities. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Andrew William Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n",
      "I wonder if I could maybe build on Bob's question with regard to -- I guess, more specifically with regard to unit economics, taking a look at the go-to bank site, maybe a little bit behind, George, as far as getting on the wait list, but I'll get there. And looking at cash back and some other products, the consumer incentives seem competitive quite rich, and I appreciate the focus on direct deposit. Dan, can you just give us some comfort that these are really good ROI products despite whether it's 6% or 7% cash back? Those are pretty those are pretty juicy returns or rewards, I should say.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "I'm really glad to hear you ask that question, but that kind of -- what will be almost skepticism, right? No, seriously because...\n",
      "Andrew William Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n",
      "I'm also Skeptical often OK.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "I know how you make your living. I know. Absolutely. The economics on this product are going to be stronger than, I think, any product that we have at Green Dot currently. And now 6% and 7% cash back rewards, those returns are funded by the merchants who are issuing those reward programs. So those won't come as a cost to us. So it's really about how we can be creative and designing really value which opportunities, propositions for the consumer that they love and embrace, and we still preserve the very good economics on our product.\n",
      "Andrew William Jeffrey -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay. I mean, as a follow-up, I guess, I'll press my luck again as a skeptic. With a product that -- for example that hasn't been announced, but we got maybe a little bit of a sneak peak around yesterday, the Amazon Flex product. I mean, do you feel like -- and that's just one example. I mean, do you feel like there's a there's a means of pressing the advantage over the long-term in terms of getting customers like that to participate in funding rewards? I mean that's, obviously, a clear positive. I just wonder if you can frame up if that's a sort of sustainable economic model, given the size of the customers.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. I think that's just an example of the sort of things that we're going to want to explore with our partners. And it's part of our new approach around our partner strategy of how can we create compelling solutions. Let's say, if we have a partner who is a retailer, we have a bank, we have the ability to -- we can open up with very little friction, a digital wallet that can reside in the apps of our partners. That's what we do now. And we could create credit building tools for consumers, with our partners. We can actually even create small low-risk loan products with our partners. We can, together with our partners, just as you mentioned, create rewards products for the consumers. So that's where -- I get really excited about what we're doing here is if you think about with go-to bank. We are very focused in creating powerful products and solutions for our direct-to-consumer business. Those products and solutions that we create we can easily expand and offer those to our partners, whereas we can in the market and we can reach a couple 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 million] customers on our own. We can take some of the products and solutions that we have created, bringing us all our partners, and we can then be reaching consumers in the tens of hundreds of millions at a time. So yes, you're spot on in terms of -- from a long-term perspective of being able to work with and engage with these partners, we have the opportunity to reach a very, very large number of consumers in this country.\n",

      "The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Ramsey Clark El-Assal -- Barclays Bank PLC -- Analyst\n",
      "I wanted to ask you about 1,099 and Gig economy and the opportunity for the company. I mean, given your investment in Gig Wages, the Amazon product, you already have an Uber product out there. Should we view this as sort of almost the primary opportunity for BaaS. When you talked about those kind of pipeline is full and potentially announcing new partners soon. Is this a real strategic pivot for the company kind of into that developing product specific to that kind of opportunity set?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "No, it's not, Ramsey. It's not a pivot. It's not a new direction. It is, but it is an important growth channel for us. So I kind of -- I'd rather ride a wave in Paola Cano and so I look for waves. And to me, the Gig economy is wave. It's a growth wave. And so if we can if you think about our partnership with Uber, this investment in partnership with Gig Wage, other potential solutions that are out there. We're becoming well equipped to serve the Gig worker. Just as we are very well equipped to serve a loader modern income consumer, just as we are working to be very well equipped to serve a small business. And through that. And all of those avenues will leverage the common denominators that we have of a bank reload network, customer service, border controls, etc. So that's -- so it's absolutely -- it's a great question. I want to be clear, this is not a -- I'm not schizophrenic. This is not a switch or a pivot. It is a way to basically take these assets that we have. And the skills that we built over decades and how do we stack new opportunities on top of them to just drive incremental revenue with attractive margin.\n",
      "Ramsey Clark El-Assal -- Barclays Bank PLC -- Analyst\n",
      "That makes a ton of sense. My follow-up is on go to bank. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of encapsulate for us. What is different about this offering relative to other kind of prior mobile-first Green Dot products like Unlimited and Gobank? Is it more of the distribution? Is the product structure itself sort of different? I was just wondering if you could elaborate there a little bit.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. Thank you for that question, Ramsey. It's -- the big difference is our commitment. And so Go-to bank is very different from all products that have been launched in the history of Green Dot because Go-to bank is it. Okay. From this point forward, there's no more NASCAR. There's no more puppy dog cards. There's no more unlimited cards, it's go to bank. And with go to bank, it's going to be go to savings, and there's going to be go to other solutions that are feature functionality tied to this go to bank account. For our consumer that we want to take this product. And by the way, it's a real bank account because it's issued by Green Dot bank. So it's not a marketing company who's hanging off of someone else has been this is a Go-to bank issue product so that we can -- we will really be able to create products and solutions to serve the full financial needs of our customers. So our goal here and our intent is, you will not be hearing a new product launch every single year from Green Dot. You will be hearing about future functionality additions to the Go Bank product on a regular basis for years to come.\n",

      "Our next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Andrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\n",
      "First question on new customer acquisition. So now that we have couple quarters post stimulus under our belt, wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of organic account growth in the quarter, for lack of a better kind of meaning. Are you seeing an elevated level of net new adds from non stimulus, non unemployment benefit customers? And any help there would be much appreciated.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "It's a good question, Andrew. I think it's hard to really pull apart of what a stimulus and what is stimulus. I can say that we have seen an elevated amount of new customers coming into the system. And again, sort of hard to dissect whether they're coming in for non stimulus versus stimulus reasons. But yes, across Q2 and Q3, we saw a significant amount of new acquisition, both in retail and then the strength of the direct business, which is in part the better marketing efforts we have and the better cost per funded, but also in large part to additional stimulus funds and just the attractiveness of our products given this digital acceleration.\n",
      "Andrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\n",
      "Understood. Okay. That's good context. And then just my follow-up, maybe I'll ask it. There's a -- obviously, a lot of news about M&A out there. Dan, I was hoping to get your view about just philosophically, how you feel about scale acquisitions versus capabilities? Just philosophically, just interested to kind of get your viewpoint on just the M&A front?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "My viewpoint in terms of what are we looking to grow through acquisitions or just like -- I'm not real clear what you're asking.\n",
      "Andrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\n",
      "Yes. The question is, how much of a priority is M&A versus growing organically?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "Andrew Garth Schmidt -- Citigroup Inc -- Analyst\n",
      "And then within the -- and then for M&A, are you open to more scale acquisitions or would be more capability focused.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Got it. Got it. So what I really like about what we have in front of us at Green Dot is we have real significant growth opportunities and potential without any acquisition. And I've always said that your ROE on organic growth is much higher than acquired growth. So I'm big fan and believer of organic growth if it comes with -- say it comes with a lot fewer problems. You're not trying to integrate a new culture or whatever out there. You know what you've got when you are signing customers and growing customers and landing on your existing infrastructure and you're using your core competency. So we don't need acquisitions to grow. So I want to make sure that's perfectly clear. However, from a standpoint of are we open? Absolutely. We're absolutely open to acquisitions that will enhance our functionality, accelerate our ability to grab some opportunities or just kind of incrementally add to our current volume. And so yes, we're -- and those would be from a small add-ons to larger that what might be even transformational.\n",

      "The next question comes from Steven Kwok of KBW. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Wai Ming Kwok -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\n",
      "The first one I had was just around the early look into 2021. I know you called out roughly $4 billion of stimulus and unemployment benefit. Should we think of that as being routine a $40 million revenue headwind. If you just use like a roughly 1% exchange rate? And then as we've -- is there any early indications around like the -- what the margins on that could be. And you mentioned there's a positive headwind or positive tailwinds around the new businesses stuff like from -- as of right now, do you feel like those can offset essentially what the headwinds could be for next year?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Sure. Good question. Jess, do you want to take it or do you want me take that?\n",
      "Jess Unruh -- Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer\n",
      "Yes. Yes, I can take it. Look, I think there's been a lot of puts and takes associated with COVID in 2020. Portions of our business were negatively impacted. We had higher dispute call center costs. While other portions of our business were positively impacted by accelerated demand for digital payments and the government benefits and it's really hard to sort of isolate the direct impact of the government benefits specifically. So I think as you think about 2021, trends in gross dollar volume per active will really start to normalize from what you've seen in Q2 and Q3. Ultimately, we believe we'll be in a better place for long-term because of that digital adoption. And I think the -- I think about sort of what that GDV means, I think about it in GDV yield as opposed to necessarily just interchange because there's fees and other things associated with it. But we can speak more to our 2021 guidance on the next call.\n",
      "Wai Ming Kwok -- Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods -- Analyst\n",
      "Got it. And separately, there was an article out there around where perhaps buying the Credit Karma's tax business. I was just wondering, is this something that you guys would possibly look at? And separately, given that they would be helping input around that? I know you guys have a relationship with Intuit as well. Just wondering in terms of your relationships with Intuit, like how long of those contracts locked up for?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "I believe we announced that we recently renewed the Intuit contract. So we have a number of years now in that new contract remaining. We don't want to get in tax preparation business. So but there's -- we did -- that opportunity did come across the desk, but we've decided that that's not in our sweet spot of skills, capabilities and where we see our growth potential.\n",

      "The next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Georgios Mihalos -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\n",
      "Just going to ask the ICT an ask two quick modeling questions and then I'll hop off. I guess the first, can you quantify or maybe I missed it, how much of an impact the nonrenewal from the retial partner will be? How much of an impact that's expected to have in the fourth quarter? And then the lower interchange yield, which I think was attributed to larger transaction size, would you expect that to sort of tick back up in the fourth quarter and sort of be more in line with what we've seen over the first half of 2020? And I'll hop off.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. I'll take that one. So yes, on the latter question around interchange yield, we're already starting to see some of that normalize back to what we see in the past of, say, 120 basis points. So the further we get from those stimulus funds coming on, the more the interchange rate normalizing. To your first question around the reload partner. We're obviously focused on generating strong cash flows and margins. Sometimes, it means you need to walk away from deals. But I think of Q4, we expect cash transfer volume to be down year-over-year. We expect the margins of our money processing business to be up. And as we think about the future, we have a pretty active BD pipeline for new reload partners and tend to add new partners next year. And then as you think about Go-to bank in our consumer products in general and us bringing them back to health. As we grow our BaaS partnerships, etc, we believe the reload network profit and margin will improve despite losing some third-party reload volume because we make more money off of reloads on our own products that we do in our third-party products.\n",

      "Thank you. The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Ashish Sabadra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n",
      "I wanted to focus on the small business accounts. You talked about Intuit and Kabbage. I was just wondering if you could help. But if you can talk about how big that addressable market is and the strategy going forward? Do you expect to sign up -- work with more partners? Or is that also a strategy to go direct to -- and try to address the small businesses directly? And then finally, is the go-to bank being also the solution for the small business customers?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. Ashish, Go-to Bank is not the solution for the small business customers. However, if you think about a lot of small businesses in this country are sole proprietors and individuals. So the future functionality on got bank is very possible that small independent operators, sole providers may pick up our Go-to bank product and make it their account, but that's definitely not the intent or the design of the product. Our opportunity around small business in the country, I mean, it's very large. I mean, there's millions of small businesses in the United States. Our partner Quickbooks they had eight million small businesses alone that use their solution. So I think as we talked on the last call, I was in a press release, you could do research and see those numbers. But we are -- QuickBooks is operating QuickBooks cash account, which is basically a bank account that's operated by Green Dot Bank and we receive income off of that account. And we're very enthusiastic about that growth potential with QuickBooks. They can just -- 12%, 15% penetration into their base, will be one million customers, one million small business accounts on our platform. And similar opportunity with Kabbage, where we have a big account of debit card issues for Kabbage small businesses. With Kabbage now being part of American Express, the growth potential there, the marketing impact of American Express behind that product is very exciting. So I can't quantify it for you right now, but it is bigger than a bread box.\n",
      "Ashish Sabadra -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n",
      "That's great. That's great. And maybe just a question on election outcomes and potential for a small second stimulus. How should we think about impact, if any, on the Green Dot just because a lot of the customers are unbanked, underbanked at the lower end of the Gig segment?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Well, Green Hat customers by the nature of having green AP products are no longer unbanked. And so a stimulus -- another stimulus check would like the prior ones would be a positive to Green Dot, and be positive in the ways the others have been positive. It will be positive in the immediate term of just additional funds to our customers will come on to the account and will be spent and generate revenue for Green Dot, but it will also create additional impetus for cash-based consumers to adopt our product and engage in electronic payment methods. So -- which we believe is -- we believe and we are already benefiting from kind of a accelerated change in consumer behavior around electronic payments.\n",

      "Jeffrey Brian Cantwell -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\n",
      "Dan, it's nice to see you guys performing well this quarter. Can I just touch on a couple of the key themes here by asking you two very simple questions, but I hope to get a serious response. First, can you tell us what are some of the learnings have been this past quarter as you're managing through this pandemic? Where are you growing more confident about Green Dot's revenue opportunity going forward? We've certainly noticed your comments about small businesses, which I think are very timely, for example, but where are you getting more confident? And where are you conversely thinking more dramatically about the company? And then I have a follow-up after that.\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "You said you're going to ask the question and you hope to get, like, I think you said a serious or maybe a nonlipid answer. So I'm trying -- I mean I feel more confident about all areas of the company. It's -- I'm feeling we still have a lot of work to do. I will not -- I'm not going to sugarcoat that. We've got a lot of bad in grain habits that we have to change across the organization. But I'm feeling really a seismic shift inside the company to where -- we have a tremendous amount of talented people who really care about what we do or they care about doing a good job. And as we -- as myself and other leaders are providing a clear direction in terms of here is what we need to do and why and here's how we generate revenue and here is why margin is important. The light bulbs are going off and people are really starting to do the right thing. And I see we've got growth potential in all areas of our business. Even -- I'll pick on retail because I think everyone kind of believes just in America today, with the shift to some much being online is that retail as an entire sector. Across the economy is as a headwind. And so -- and for our business, I mean, we're not immune from the challenges as foot traffic is dropping in retailers. But we're in some very interesting conversations with a number of our retail partners now, how can we expand our footprint not just in their store, but into the daily lives of their consumers, how can we expand financial services and offerings to their customers and partnership. So I believe that we've got growth potential in our Paycard business and our tax business and our retail business, certainly in our direct-to-consumer business. And what I love about all that is you think about the competitive advantage that, that affords us in terms of striking out on powerful, disruptive large opportunities with a lot of our mass partners. We've got a bank all the assets have already ran a Relo network bank, call center operations, fraud controls, technology stack. All of those solutions are bought and paid for with our existing core businesses, which are all growing. And so now if we want to get creative and aggressive with some major partners, so we can collectively change the world, we've got that opportunity.\n",
      "Jeffrey Brian Cantwell -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay. That great color. And that leads to my follow-up. With go to bank, can you drill down a little bit for us on the strategy there for customer acquisition? I'm hearing you on the go-to bank value proposition, I'm understanding the strategic rationale for making this to go-to product. So Dan, if I'm a consumer in your 2020, I have a number of options, right? I have these newer bank options, I have traditional bank options and have Green Dot. So my question to you is -- and given all your experience in the industry, I want to ask if you can help investors understand how you're going to drive new customers to Green Dot?\n",
      "Dan Henry -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Sure. I think that what's important to say and I've said it for the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, the total available market is tremendous, right? And it's not a zero-sum game. And so just as there is chase in Wells Fargo and Bank of America and Compass and BBVA, I mean, there is room for a significant number of FIs, if you will, offering solutions to consumers. And so we will market in our traditional fashion that we have done, we're going to do it much, in my opinion, we're going to do it better, smarter. We're going to do a significant amount of research. We spend our money effectively. We have a tremendous amount of research around the name Go-to bank and the design of Go-to bank and research around the products we're offering and how pricing them. We'll get a better return on every one of the marketing dollars that we spend. And I know this -- I just know this. I know this from my days at Netspend. I know this from sitting on the Board and being an investor in other prepaid companies over the years that you build a good solid product and you market it effectively, you will get your fair share of customers. And so we will get our fair share of customers. And yes, customers will have to choose between us and a few other offerings. And we'll get our fair share of customers will choose our solution over others, and we will grow that business.\n",

      "Good afternoon, and welcome to the <ORG> Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to <PERSON>, Vice President of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Vice President Corporate Communications\n",
      "Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are discussing <ORG> third quarter 2020 financial and operating results. Following remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Our most recent earnings release that accompanies this call and webcast can be found at ir.greendot.com. As a reminder, our comments may include forward-looking statements and expectations regarding future results and performance. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and in <ORG> filings with <ORG>, including our most recent Form 10-K and <ORG> for additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.\n",
      "During the call, we'll make reference to our financial measures that do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles. For the sake of forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll make reference to our financial measures that do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles for the sake of clarity, presented by other companies. Quantitative reconciliation of our <ORG> information to the directly comparable <ORG> financial information appears in today's press release. The content of this call is property of <ORG> and is subject to copyright protection.\n",
      "Now I'd like to turn the call over to <PERSON>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Thank you, <PERSON>. Welcome, everyone, to <ORG> Q3 2020 Earnings Call. It's been a busy and productive few months since we last gathered. We are pleased to report a better-than-expected third quarter, which we attribute to a number of factors, including our continued work to drive efficiencies and lower cost and increased demand for our products across our consumer, retail and B2B offerings. We remain focused on unlocking new opportunities and capitalizing on the accelerated shift from cash to digital banking and payments which was further eliminated by the pandemic and other dynamics taking place in the marketplace. As we end, we are already seeing benefits from our work-from-anywhere initiative from both a cost savings and talent recruitment perspective. In a few minutes, I'll pass it over to <PERSON> to walk you through the details of our financial results, but I'd like to start by sharing a few highlights and my perspective on what contributed to a solid third quarter. I'm going to focus on three key areas of progress to stem back to the objectives I laid out earlier this year.\n",
      "These will include improving our financial performance and execution, refocusing and enhancing our bass strategy and launching our new and lasting challenger bank initiative. While <PERSON> will cover the financial performance in detail, let me provide you with my take on the results for the quarter. Non-GAAP revenue increased 22% compared with the third quarter of the prior year. This higher revenue was driven by a combination of new and existing customers using Green Dot products to electronically receive your income, elevated deposit balances from stimulus funds received in Q2, growth in our BaaS partner fees and accelerated demand for digital banking and payments products. We also started to see recovery in areas of our business that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Our total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 increased by $42 million compared to the third quarter of the prior year, and our margins expanded by approximately 100 basis points. A big component of the increase in operating expenses was related to growth of our BaaS business.\n",
      "We also had lower marketing expenses in the quarter. If you recall, <ORG> spent a majority of its full 2019 marketing budget in the second half of 2019. Finally, we had a few headwinds to margins, especially and increased revenue share with one of our key retail partners, higher transaction losses on our purchase volume and the timing-related expenses associated with incentive compensation for our employees. Moving on to our BaaS business. As we previously announced, we officially kicked off new relationships with <ORG> and <ORG> in the third quarter, which further positions <ORG> to serve and Empower America's 30 million plus small businesses and entrepreneurs. Leveraging Green Dot's capabilities into it announced their plans to launch a <ORG> cash account and <ORG> announced plans for <ORG> checking. We're also very excited about <ORG>'s accelerated potential now that there are parts of <ORG>. Through these products, small business owners will now have access to more seamless, safe and value-driven banking and cash management for their businesses. We're incredibly proud to be a part of this movement, and look forward to deepening our partnerships with <ORG> and <ORG> and doing more for small businesses in the future. We believe the opportunity for <ORG> to offer its services to the vast SMB segment is immense, and we look forward to providing you with more updates regarding this opportunity.\n",
      "On that note, you may have seen an exciting announcement last week about a new strategic investment and partnership with <ORG>, which for those who may not be familiar, is a very impressive and fast-growing start-up, focused on creating a better financial ecosystem for the rapidly expanding gig economy. I met <ORG> founder <PERSON>, earlier this year, it quickly became clear that we have similar goals and visions for the industry and for our customers and that we could do a lot together. <ORG> Led <ORG> Series A funding round, and we will serve as their infrastructure bank partner, enabling <ORG> to launch a number of new financial solutions designed for 1,099 workers and their employers. As a strategic investor and BaaS partner, <ORG> has an exciting opportunity to grow this vertical and capitalize on the growing demand for better banking and payment solutions for the Gig economy. Also, we have a few new partners we will be announcing soon. Brands that everyone will know and recognize. One thing I want to reiterate is our commitment to partnering with <ORG> high-impact and high-potential companies, meaning they are highly respected brands with very impressive reach or their start-ups with tremendous potential, which we will differentiate ourselves as a BaaS provider by acting, not just as a bank sponsorship, but also a true partner, providing end-to-end support, spanning technology, program management, call center support, fraud and our retail network and more.\n",
      "Which we consider a huge differentiator of Green Dot. Last but certainly not least, one of the most important and exciting areas of focus and progress has been unlocking our potential as a powerful challenger bank. Earlier this year, one of the goals I set for the company was to introduce a new direct-to-consumer bank, and that vision will come to fruition very soon. Last week, we officially launched our wait list for go-to bank, which is an entirely new and simplified digital banking experience that will offer meaningful value and features designed to save people time and money and manage and move money effortlessly. We chose go-to bank as our new brand by doing some pretty extensive research and because we want this product to be the go-to destination for modern banking and money movement for everyone wherever they go. <ORG> will be a solution designed primarily for low to moderate-income consumers who are looking for and can benefit from a better way to bank and transact. And we plan to expand the target market as we enhance the product features and services over time.\n",
      "As one of the only challenger banks to actually be a bank, <ORG> bank will position <ORG> to compete aggressively and profitably. When we launch early next year, <ORG> will offer a compelling value proposition to a wide range of customers, including the security and protection that comes with a member <ORG> bank, an intuitive mobile app and experience where you can quickly set up and manage your account, no monthly fees when we use direct deposit, free in network ATMs, 10 times national average API and other valuable features and rewards. And our plan is to expand on those features quickly. This new brand and product set represent a meaningful and long-term commitment and strategy for <ORG>. So you can expect to see a lot more of this in 2021 and beyond. While we intend to spend to develop the <ORG> bank brand and acquire customers, our marketing dollars will be based on a data-driven marketing strategy driven by thoughtful and rigorous return on investment requirements and expectations for lifetime value. <ORG> has a proud 20-year history of serving over 33 million customers through our retail direct-to-consumer products and many more through our banking partners like <ORG>, Apple, <ORG> and other well-known innovative brands.\n",
      "We know how to build products that make money movement and access more seamless, intuitive and safe for everyone. We also know there is a significant segment of our population that continues to be underserved by the financial services industry, and we have the opportunity to change that with <ORG>. I encourage you to visit Go-to-bank.com and join our wait list. As you may be able to tell, we have been incredibly busy laying the foundation to deliver value-added products and services to our customers, directly as well as through our valuable BaaS partners. At the same time, we are delivering on our commitment to rightsize the cost structure and establish sustainable operating leverage, which will create value to you, our shareholders. I would like to thank our valuable employees who have been working tirelessly through these challenging times.\n",
      "And with that, I'll pass it over to <PERSON> to walk through our numbers.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer\n",
      "Thanks, <PERSON>. Good afternoon, everyone. Overall, <ORG> had strong financial results in the quarter and significantly exceeded our internal expectations from three months ago. The momentum we saw in Q2 from stimulus funds, unemployment benefits, and new users on the platform carried into Q3. We are pleased that the scale of our platform and our market reach puts us in a position to benefit from the accelerated adoption of digital payments. Our Q3 2020 non-GAAP revenue grew 22% to $279 million, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $34 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.25. We experienced a few significant tailwinds as well as headwinds in the quarter that I'll walk you through. Overall, we were pleased with the strength of the consolidated performance. Focusing on our top line results for a moment, non-GAAP revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by our account programs, with strong performance in key metrics such as account acquisition, gross dollar volume and purchase volume.\n",
      "The growth in gross dollar volume was driven in part by the extension of federal unemployment benefits and higher levels of tax refund deposits onto our account programs due to the extension of the tax filing deadlines to July 2020. Altogether, this resulted in increased management service fees from our BaaS partners, increased monthly maintenance fees from elevated deposit balances and growth in interchange revenue. Consistent with the previous quarter, the interchange rate we earned was down year-over-year in Q3 due to a 30% increase in the average ticket size per transaction. Since interchange fees have both fixed and variable components, we earned smaller fees in percentage terms on larger transactions, partially offsetting the increase in revenue in our account segment was an increase in cash rewards related to <ORG> unlimited accounts. We also experienced revenue growth in our money movement services, primarily due to a 9% growth in the number of cash transfers, a significant growth in tax refunds processed from the shift in the tax filing deadline and continued growth in new tax processing services we introduced this year.\n",
      "Partially offsetting this growth was a year-over-year decline in simply paid disbursement transactions as a result of the disruption in the ridesharing business from the effects of COVID-19. Another headwind discussed on prior calls was the year-over-year decline in net interest income due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances as a result of rate cuts by <ORG> earlier this year. Let me turn my attention to our expenses and margins. Our total non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 grew by $42 million or 20% year-over-year, and our margins expanded approximately 100 basis points. Sales and marketing expenses declined by 5% due to lower marketing expenses year-over-year. Our marketing spend in 2019 was heavily concentrated in the back half of the year, whereas we are spreading the spend more evenly across 2020. The lower marketing expense was partially offset by an increase in revenue share with our partners, including an increased revenue share rate associated with last year's renewal of the <ORG> Moneycard program. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 18% due to incentive compensation for our employees. Consistent with our commentary on our prior earnings call, we've reinvested some of our planned SG&A saves to incentivize and reward our nonexecutive employees for their extraordinary efforts to serve our customers and execute on our priorities as we navigate through the pandemic. Processing expenses increased 60%, in line with corresponding revenue increase in our BaaS fees and interchange revenue.\n",
      "Other general and administrative expenses increased to 43%, mainly as a result of an increase in transactional losses from higher volumes of customer disputes. In Q2, we experienced a significant increase in transaction losses primarily due to operational disruptions caused by COVID-19. In Q3 and likely for the remainder of this year, the basis points of loss on transactions will be a headwind to margins as we continue to work diligently on improving the customer experience and align our fraud prevention processes with the industry's best practices and performance. We expect loss rates will begin to normalize in 2021. Depreciation expense in Q3 increased to 15% year-over-year due to increased capitalization development costs over the past several years to support our strategic initiatives. We expect depreciation expense to increase in the short-term and then begin to flatten out as we reduced the level of overall spend on development by consolidating some of our products and focusing on prioritizing our development based on strategic impact and incremental operating margins. From a liquidity perspective, we generated $37 million of operating cash flow during Q3 and $199 million year-to-date. Our cash at the holding company at quarter end was $152 million. The $100 million revolver is available to us should be needed to invest in strategic initiatives. Now I'd like to focus on expectations for the remainder of the year. As we look ahead, while our business remains very healthy, it is important to remember that Q2 benefited from approximately $2 billion of gross dollar volume from stimulus funds and Q3 had a follow-on benefit from elevated deposits.\n",
      "Additionally, Q2 and Q3, in aggregate, benefited from approximately $2 billion of incremental federal unemployment benefits afforded under the Cares Act. While we are well positioned to continue to benefit from the accelerated adoption of digital payments, we expect our KPIs to continue to normalize that stimulus disbursements roll off and the enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. While each of account acquisition, gross dollar volume and purchase volume were in Q3, above long-term historical trends, we do anticipate that normalization will occur throughout Q4 2020. One item to note for Q4 is that we expect a year-over-year decline in cash transfers. We decided to not renew an agreement with a large reload partner because of proposed renewal terms and associated margins did not meet our expectations. Thus, our cash transfer volumes and the related topline revenue will be impacted.\n",
      "But given the lower profitability of this contract, we actually expect the overall percentage contribution margin in our money processing channel to improve. As we think about the full year 2020, we expect our non-GAAP revenues will be in the range of $1.175 billion to $1.185 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $195 million to $200 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.95 to $2. These ranges do not anticipate another significant federal stimulus program nor do they anticipate a further economic slowdown from the impact of COVID-19. In conclusion, we remain focused on reducing the overall complexity of our operations with the goal of generating consistent operating leverage in the years to come. We believe decisions made this year will begin to benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Speaking of 2021, we expect to provide formal guidance for the year when we report our Q4 2020 results in February. While we're still in our budget process, we would like to provide some insights for you to consider as you build your models. First, we will have positive impact from initiatives discussed earlier, including new BaaS partnerships and Go-to bank as well as various costs and capital efficiencies. We will also have year-over-year headwinds associated with the government benefits that positively impacted our 2020 results, as we discussed earlier. We look forward to providing a more detailed discussion on our next earnings call.\n",
      "With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\n",
      "Questions and Answers:\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Thank you. Good afternoon. <PERSON>. Lot going on. Just maybe a first question, just on direct deposit. And I mean the -- your prior roles. I mean, direct deposit was a big focus. I know it's a big focus here. The penetration rate currently is about 40% on direct deposit accounts. Is there a strategy around building the direct deposit customer base at a faster rate? If so, what is it and what kind of a penetration rate or other metrics would you judge with the success of that program on?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes, <PERSON>, I think your question, I think, illustrates the knowledge and awareness of like from what we do. The direct deposit customer is extremely valuable customer. So as we -- when we launch our challenger <ORG> initiative early next year, we will be very focused on driving that direct deposit growth with that product. So in terms of any sort of metrics or levels of success, can't give those to you at this point? But yes, it's going to be a cornerstone to our strategy and our focus on growth.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, the new partners, it sounds like you have a pipeline of new large and small partners, as you mentioned, start ups and well-known brands. Is there a different approach to those new partners versus what <ORG> has had in the past or is it more partnership as we view? And would this generate higher ROIs maybe than some of the partnerships in the past?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "No. The approach file is different. And I don't know what was shared publicly, but from my understanding is or my approach is very much of a quality instead of a quantity in terms of partners. And if you think about what we have at <ORG>, we have a very unique collection of assets. I mean I'll say right now, I don't like the bath acronym for us because we do a lot more than just give access to our bin, so I think banking as a service. We can bring to our partners -- our partnerships a bank. We can bring logistic expertise in terms of insulin plastic. We've got a tech stack. We have a reload network. We have customer service call centers, management expertise. We've got fraud management expertise. So we bring a whole collection of services. And so our new approach is not to just let any fintech come along and kind of take us one piece at a time of our service, but more look for large partners, like many of the ones we have that are looking for kind of an all-encompassing solution and relationship, work to deepen that relationship and bring powerful products and solutions that really nobody else can offer because nobody else has a collection of the assets we have, bring those to large partners who can really drive scale for us in adoption of the masses with those solutions. And then on the other side of the spectrum, more partnerships with companies like <ORG>. It's -- <PERSON>, the CEO of that and founder of that business, he's a tremendous entrepreneur, a hard charging. He's built a great low platform. He's got some great prospects in terms of a growing wave of the Gig economy. And we want to play in that, and we see being able to invest in a company like <ORG>, truly be their partner and help them grow and grow with them in the Gig economy. That's the strategy we want to do on our partner approach. So as I said, what I just read is it's either large partners with tremendous reach, are small, very powerful partners with tremendous growth potential.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "The next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Congratulations to me. I'm the latest wake less customer for the new <ORG> offering. So <PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Go to bank. We will be your go to bank for all your seamless and frictionless financial services. So glad to have you on board.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "If you can handle all my wife needs, very impressed. So question competitively. <ORG> just announced entrance into the bass market. <ORG> had to give up a customer because they had reached two large a size and couldn't work with rev share. I think <ORG> will have the same issue. So curious how you're -- and I happy that you're defining some of your capabilities a little bit more specifically. But I'm curious, competitively, when I look at that larger landscape and issues that some might run into. And then look at the sort of some of the bigger opportunities in the space. Just help us understand when you're building up this pipeline how competitive it is. And I would also like to add, and I don't need a follow-up question. So this will be my follow-up question. The renewal deal that you didn't go forward with and how that demonstrates customers you might be moving away from?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Sure. So the renewal we passed on was with a partner that was only using our reload network. And so we -- what we saw there was somebody who was demanding high volume in service with next to no margin, sometimes negative margin, and we were not willing to go there. Especially, as I said, they were just doing an a la carte solution where all they wanted to use was our reload network. So I will walk from that partner. In terms of the other thing, your other question in regards to how we -- as our bank grows with all these new partners, how do we maintain the asset level. Really don't want to get into a lot of detail on that, but other just to share that we're very confident that as we structure our business, <PERSON>, who's now the CEO of our bank. We can run our bank. We can stay below the $10 billion asset level for a long, long time with very significant volume coming across our institution. And if you compare that with, say, a <ORG> bank or whatever banks are out there now jumping on the BaaS wagon. Those banks are entirely different types of banks than we are. Those are traditional financial institutions that do all sorts of banking and lending, and they want to be $300 million, $400 billion in assets. And so that's -- they will have a different issue, and we'll be able to protect our revenue with higher interchange by maintaining our $10 billion or less asset size.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "Thank you. Your next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "I wonder if I could maybe build on <PERSON>'s question with regard to -- I guess, more specifically with regard to unit economics, taking a look at the go-to bank site, maybe a little bit behind, <PERSON>, as far as getting on the wait list, but I'll get there. And looking at cash back and some other products, the consumer incentives seem competitive quite rich, and I appreciate the focus on direct deposit. <PERSON>, can you just give us some comfort that these are really good ROI products despite whether it's 6% or 7% cash back? Those are pretty those are pretty juicy returns or rewards, I should say.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "I'm really glad to hear you ask that question, but that kind of -- what will be almost skepticism, right? No, seriously because...\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "I'm also Skeptical often OK.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "I know how you make your living. I know. Absolutely. The economics on this product are going to be stronger than, I think, any product that we have at <ORG> currently. And now 6% and 7% cash back rewards, those returns are funded by the merchants who are issuing those reward programs. So those won't come as a cost to us. So it's really about how we can be creative and designing really value which opportunities, propositions for the consumer that they love and embrace, and we still preserve the very good economics on our product.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay. I mean, as a follow-up, I guess, I'll press my luck again as a skeptic. With a product that -- for example that hasn't been announced, but we got maybe a little bit of a sneak peak around yesterday, the <ORG> Flex product. I mean, do you feel like -- and that's just one example. I mean, do you feel like there's a there's a means of pressing the advantage over the long-term in terms of getting customers like that to participate in funding rewards? I mean that's, obviously, a clear positive. I just wonder if you can frame up if that's a sort of sustainable economic model, given the size of the customers.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. I think that's just an example of the sort of things that we're going to want to explore with our partners. And it's part of our new approach around our partner strategy of how can we create compelling solutions. Let's say, if we have a partner who is a retailer, we have a bank, we have the ability to -- we can open up with very little friction, a digital wallet that can reside in the apps of our partners. That's what we do now. And we could create credit building tools for consumers, with our partners. We can actually even create small low-risk loan products with our partners. We can, together with our partners, just as you mentioned, create rewards products for the consumers. So that's where -- I get really excited about what we're doing here is if you think about with go-to bank. We are very focused in creating powerful products and solutions for our direct-to-consumer business. Those products and solutions that we create we can easily expand and offer those to our partners, whereas we can in the market and we can reach a couple 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 million] customers on our own. We can take some of the products and solutions that we have created, bringing us all our partners, and we can then be reaching consumers in the tens of hundreds of millions at a time. So yes, you're spot on in terms of -- from a long-term perspective of being able to work with and engage with these partners, we have the opportunity to reach a very, very large number of consumers in this country.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "The next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "I wanted to ask you about 1,099 and Gig economy and the opportunity for the company. I mean, given your investment in Gig Wages, the <ORG> product, you already have an <ORG> product out there. Should we view this as sort of almost the primary opportunity for BaaS. When you talked about those kind of pipeline is full and potentially announcing new partners soon. Is this a real strategic pivot for the company kind of into that developing product specific to that kind of opportunity set?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "No, it's not, <PERSON>. It's not a pivot. It's not a new direction. It is, but it is an important growth channel for us. So I kind of -- I'd rather ride a wave in <PERSON> and so I look for waves. And to me, the Gig economy is wave. It's a growth wave. And so if we can if you think about our partnership with <ORG>, this investment in partnership with <ORG>, other potential solutions that are out there. We're becoming well equipped to serve the Gig worker. Just as we are very well equipped to serve a loader modern income consumer, just as we are working to be very well equipped to serve a small business. And through that. And all of those avenues will leverage the common denominators that we have of a bank reload network, customer service, border controls, etc. So that's -- so it's absolutely -- it's a great question. I want to be clear, this is not a -- I'm not schizophrenic. This is not a switch or a pivot. It is a way to basically take these assets that we have. And the skills that we built over decades and how do we stack new opportunities on top of them to just drive incremental revenue with attractive margin.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "That makes a ton of sense. My follow-up is on go to bank. And I'm just wondering if you could kind of encapsulate for us. What is different about this offering relative to other kind of prior mobile-first Green Dot products like Unlimited and Gobank? Is it more of the distribution? Is the product structure itself sort of different? I was just wondering if you could elaborate there a little bit.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. Thank you for that question, <PERSON>. It's -- the big difference is our commitment. And so Go-to bank is very different from all products that have been launched in the history of Green Dot because Go-to bank is it. Okay. From this point forward, there's no more <ORG>. There's no more puppy dog cards. There's no more unlimited cards, it's go to bank. And with go to bank, it's going to be go to savings, and there's going to be go to other solutions that are feature functionality tied to this go to bank account. For our consumer that we want to take this product. And by the way, it's a real bank account because it's issued by <ORG>. So it's not a marketing company who's hanging off of someone else has been this is a Go-to bank issue product so that we can -- we will really be able to create products and solutions to serve the full financial needs of our customers. So our goal here and our intent is, you will not be hearing a new product launch every single year from <ORG>. You will be hearing about future functionality additions to the <ORG> product on a regular basis for years to come.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay, all right. Thanks so much.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "Our next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "First question on new customer acquisition. So now that we have couple quarters post stimulus under our belt, wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of organic account growth in the quarter, for lack of a better kind of meaning. Are you seeing an elevated level of net new adds from non stimulus, non unemployment benefit customers? And any help there would be much appreciated.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "It's a good question, <PERSON>. I think it's hard to really pull apart of what a stimulus and what is stimulus. I can say that we have seen an elevated amount of new customers coming into the system. And again, sort of hard to dissect whether they're coming in for non stimulus versus stimulus reasons. But yes, across Q2 and Q3, we saw a significant amount of new acquisition, both in retail and then the strength of the direct business, which is in part the better marketing efforts we have and the better cost per funded, but also in large part to additional stimulus funds and just the attractiveness of our products given this digital acceleration.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Understood. Okay. That's good context. And then just my follow-up, maybe I'll ask it. There's a -- obviously, a lot of news about M&A out there. <PERSON>, I was hoping to get your view about just philosophically, how you feel about scale acquisitions versus capabilities? Just philosophically, just interested to kind of get your viewpoint on just the M&A front?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "My viewpoint in terms of what are we looking to grow through acquisitions or just like -- I'm not real clear what you're asking.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Yes. The question is, how much of a priority is M&A versus growing organically?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "And then within the -- and then for M&A, are you open to more scale acquisitions or would be more capability focused.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Got it. Got it. So what I really like about what we have in front of us at <ORG> is we have real significant growth opportunities and potential without any acquisition. And I've always said that your ROE on organic growth is much higher than acquired growth. So I'm big fan and believer of organic growth if it comes with -- say it comes with a lot fewer problems. You're not trying to integrate a new culture or whatever out there. You know what you've got when you are signing customers and growing customers and landing on your existing infrastructure and you're using your core competency. So we don't need acquisitions to grow. So I want to make sure that's perfectly clear. However, from a standpoint of are we open? Absolutely. We're absolutely open to acquisitions that will enhance our functionality, accelerate our ability to grab some opportunities or just kind of incrementally add to our current volume. And so yes, we're -- and those would be from a small add-ons to larger that what might be even transformational.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay, understood. Thanks, <PERSON>.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "The next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "The first one I had was just around the early look into 2021. I know you called out roughly $4 billion of stimulus and unemployment benefit. Should we think of that as being routine a $40 million revenue headwind. If you just use like a roughly 1% exchange rate? And then as we've -- is there any early indications around like the -- what the margins on that could be. And you mentioned there's a positive headwind or positive tailwinds around the new businesses stuff like from -- as of right now, do you feel like those can offset essentially what the headwinds could be for next year?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Sure. Good question. <PERSON>, do you want to take it or do you want me take that?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer\n",
      "Yes. Yes, I can take it. Look, I think there's been a lot of puts and takes associated with <ORG> in 2020. Portions of our business were negatively impacted. We had higher dispute call center costs. While other portions of our business were positively impacted by accelerated demand for digital payments and the government benefits and it's really hard to sort of isolate the direct impact of the government benefits specifically. So I think as you think about 2021, trends in gross dollar volume per active will really start to normalize from what you've seen in Q2 and Q3. Ultimately, we believe we'll be in a better place for long-term because of that digital adoption. And I think the -- I think about sort of what that GDV means, I think about it in GDV yield as opposed to necessarily just interchange because there's fees and other things associated with it. But we can speak more to our 2021 guidance on the next call.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Got it. And separately, there was an article out there around where perhaps buying <ORG> tax business. I was just wondering, is this something that you guys would possibly look at? And separately, given that they would be helping input around that? I know you guys have a relationship with <ORG> as well. Just wondering in terms of your relationships with <ORG>, like how long of those contracts locked up for?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "I believe we announced that we recently renewed the <ORG> contract. So we have a number of years now in that new contract remaining. We don't want to get in tax preparation business. So but there's -- we did -- that opportunity did come across the desk, but we've decided that that's not in our sweet spot of skills, capabilities and where we see our growth potential.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "All right, thanks for taking my question.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Absolutely. Thank you\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "The next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Just going to ask the ICT an ask two quick modeling questions and then I'll hop off. I guess the first, can you quantify or maybe I missed it, how much of an impact the nonrenewal from the retial partner will be? How much of an impact that's expected to have in the fourth quarter? And then the lower interchange yield, which I think was attributed to larger transaction size, would you expect that to sort of tick back up in the fourth quarter and sort of be more in line with what we've seen over the first half of 2020? And I'll hop off.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. I'll take that one. So yes, on the latter question around interchange yield, we're already starting to see some of that normalize back to what we see in the past of, say, 120 basis points. So the further we get from those stimulus funds coming on, the more the interchange rate normalizing. To your first question around the reload partner. We're obviously focused on generating strong cash flows and margins. Sometimes, it means you need to walk away from deals. But I think of Q4, we expect cash transfer volume to be down year-over-year. We expect the margins of our money processing business to be up. And as we think about the future, we have a pretty active BD pipeline for new reload partners and tend to add new partners next year. And then as you think about Go-to bank in our consumer products in general and us bringing them back to health. As we grow our BaaS partnerships, etc, we believe the reload network profit and margin will improve despite losing some third-party reload volume because we make more money off of reloads on our own products that we do in our third-party products.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "Thank you. The next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "I wanted to focus on the small business accounts. You talked about <ORG> and <ORG>. I was just wondering if you could help. But if you can talk about how big that addressable market is and the strategy going forward? Do you expect to sign up -- work with more partners? Or is that also a strategy to go direct to -- and try to address the small businesses directly? And then finally, is the go-to bank being also the solution for the small business customers?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yes. <PERSON>, <ORG> is not the solution for the small business customers. However, if you think about a lot of small businesses in this country are sole proprietors and individuals. So the future functionality on got bank is very possible that small independent operators, sole providers may pick up our Go-to bank product and make it their account, but that's definitely not the intent or the design of the product. Our opportunity around small business in the country, I mean, it's very large. I mean, there's millions of small businesses in the United States. Our partner <ORG> they had eight million small businesses alone that use their solution. So I think as we talked on the last call, I was in a press release, you could do research and see those numbers. But we are -- <ORG> is operating <ORG> cash account, which is basically a bank account that's operated by <ORG> and we receive income off of that account. And we're very enthusiastic about that growth potential with <ORG>. They can just -- 12%, 15% penetration into their base, will be one million customers, one million small business accounts on our platform. And similar opportunity with <ORG>, where we have a big account of debit card issues for <ORG> small businesses. With <ORG> now being part of <ORG>, the growth potential there, the marketing impact of <ORG> behind that product is very exciting. So I can't quantify it for you right now, but it is bigger than a bread box.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "That's great. That's great. And maybe just a question on election outcomes and potential for a small second stimulus. How should we think about impact, if any, on the Green Dot just because a lot of the customers are unbanked, underbanked at the lower end of the Gig segment?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Well, Green Hat customers by the nature of having green AP products are no longer unbanked. And so a stimulus -- another stimulus check would like the prior ones would be a positive to Green Dot, and be positive in the ways the others have been positive. It will be positive in the immediate term of just additional funds to our customers will come on to the account and will be spent and generate revenue for Green Dot, but it will also create additional impetus for cash-based consumers to adopt our product and engage in electronic payment methods. So -- which we believe is -- we believe and we are already benefiting from kind of a accelerated change in consumer behavior around electronic payments.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Thanks. That's very helpful.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Yeah. Thank you. <PERSON>\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "The next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "<PERSON>, it's nice to see you guys performing well this quarter. Can I just touch on a couple of the key themes here by asking you two very simple questions, but I hope to get a serious response. First, can you tell us what are some of the learnings have been this past quarter as you're managing through this pandemic? Where are you growing more confident about <ORG> revenue opportunity going forward? We've certainly noticed your comments about small businesses, which I think are very timely, for example, but where are you getting more confident? And where are you conversely thinking more dramatically about the company? And then I have a follow-up after that.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "You said you're going to ask the question and you hope to get, like, I think you said a serious or maybe a nonlipid answer. So I'm trying -- I mean I feel more confident about all areas of the company. It's -- I'm feeling we still have a lot of work to do. I will not -- I'm not going to sugarcoat that. We've got a lot of bad in grain habits that we have to change across the organization. But I'm feeling really a seismic shift inside the company to where -- we have a tremendous amount of talented people who really care about what we do or they care about doing a good job. And as we -- as myself and other leaders are providing a clear direction in terms of here is what we need to do and why and here's how we generate revenue and here is why margin is important. The light bulbs are going off and people are really starting to do the right thing. And I see we've got growth potential in all areas of our business. Even -- I'll pick on retail because I think everyone kind of believes just in America today, with the shift to some much being online is that retail as an entire sector. Across the economy is as a headwind. And so -- and for our business, I mean, we're not immune from the challenges as foot traffic is dropping in retailers. But we're in some very interesting conversations with a number of our retail partners now, how can we expand our footprint not just in their store, but into the daily lives of their consumers, how can we expand financial services and offerings to their customers and partnership. So I believe that we've got growth potential in our <ORG> business and our tax business and our retail business, certainly in our direct-to-consumer business. And what I love about all that is you think about the competitive advantage that, that affords us in terms of striking out on powerful, disruptive large opportunities with a lot of our mass partners. We've got a bank all the assets have already ran a <ORG> network bank, call center operations, fraud controls, technology stack. All of those solutions are bought and paid for with our existing core businesses, which are all growing. And so now if we want to get creative and aggressive with some major partners, so we can collectively change the world, we've got that opportunity.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay. That great color. And that leads to my follow-up. With go to bank, can you drill down a little bit for us on the strategy there for customer acquisition? I'm hearing you on the go-to bank value proposition, I'm understanding the strategic rationale for making this to go-to product. So <PERSON>, if I'm a consumer in your 2020, I have a number of options, right? I have these newer bank options, I have traditional bank options and have Green Dot. So my question to you is -- and given all your experience in the industry, I want to ask if you can help investors understand how you're going to drive new customers to Green Dot?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Director, Chief Executive Officer, and President\n",
      "Sure. I think that what's important to say and I've said it for the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, the total available market is tremendous, right? And it's not a zero-sum game. And so just as there is chase in <ORG> and <ORG> and <ORG> and <ORG>, I mean, there is room for a significant number of FIs, if you will, offering solutions to consumers. And so we will market in our traditional fashion that we have done, we're going to do it much, in my opinion, we're going to do it better, smarter. We're going to do a significant amount of research. We spend our money effectively. We have a tremendous amount of research around the name <ORG> and the design of <ORG> and research around the products we're offering and how pricing them. We'll get a better return on every one of the marketing dollars that we spend. And I know this -- I just know this. I know this from my days at <ORG>. I know this from sitting on the Board and being an investor in other prepaid companies over the years that you build a good solid product and you market it effectively, you will get your fair share of customers. And so we will get our fair share of customers. And yes, customers will have to choose between us and a few other offerings. And we'll get our fair share of customers will choose our solution over others, and we will grow that business.\n",

      "Operator\n",
      "Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to <ORG> Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to <PERSON>, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. With me on the call is <PERSON>, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our call is being recorded and will be available for playback, the details of which are in our press release issued earlier today.\n",
      "As in the past, our comments will include forward-looking statements about the company's performance based on our views of <ORG>'s businesses and the environments in which they operate. Such statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that can change as the world changes. Please see the cautionary statements in today's press release and in our various <ORG> filings.\n",
      "Finally, some of today's remarks will adjust for those items that affect comparability between periods. These items are explained in our non-GAAP reconciliations included in our press release. Now, I'll turn the call over to <PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Thanks, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you and all your families are doing well in these turbulent times. <ORG> entered the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic from a position of strength, both operationally and competitively. Building on our already strong results in this fiscal year prior to March, our businesses have benefited from the stay-at-home nature of the pandemic. Both existing and new customers have been investing in home projects such as closet renovations, tending to their lawns and gardens and enhancing their enjoyment of the outdoors, upgrading the exterior of their homes, including their garage doors. We believe these trends will continue to grow in the years ahead.\n",
      "Our third quarter results were outstanding. Revenues increased 10%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% and adjusted earnings per share increased 90% compared to the prior year period. These results are a reflection of the strategic actions taken by <ORG> starting with the September 2017 announcement regarding the disposition of our <ORG> business and the purchase of <ORG>, further enhanced by the purchase of <ORG> in June of 2018, coupled with the home improvement trends that I described. Our pivot out of the capital-intensive, commodity-driven <ORG> business into branded domestically manufactured Consumer and Professional Product businesses positioned us for market share gains, as well as revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth.\n",
      "Further underscoring this quarter's results, our 2020 nine-month free cash flow increased $34 million over the comparable 2019 nine-month period and builds on the prior year's full year free cash flow of $69 million. As a result of this performance, our net debt to EBITDA leverage has been reduced by one full turn from the prior year quarter to 4.4 times.\n",
      "Ensuring the health and safety of our employees and our customers continues to be our top priority. Since early March, we have proactively implemented health and safety measures across our global workforce as local and national authorities have circulated additional guidelines for employee health and safety. We've incorporated those as well. All of our facilities are operational and continue to maintain additional safety measures to protect our workers, while maintaining operations.\n",
      "In Consumer and Professional Products and Home and Building Products, all of our U.S., Canadian, and Australian facilities were operational throughout the quarter. This includes all <ORG>, <ORG>, <ORG> and <ORG> facilities. Each of these businesses provide critical products supporting national infrastructure. To the extent practical, we continue to permit our employees in these segments to work remotely and as I've mentioned before, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities have implemented strict protocols to ensure employee health and safety, while at the workplace.\n",
      "In late March, our <ORG> U.K. facilities were closed by government directive and our employees were directed to stay at home. By early June, we were able to reopen our facility there, which was ahead of our anticipated July resumption of operations. In Mexico, our <ORG> manufacturing facility that supports the U.S. and Canada sales closed for approximately 1.5 weeks in April, but has been operational since.\n",
      "Turning to our <ORG> business. <ORG> continues to operate at all of its sites as it provides critical manufacturing and services supporting the U.S. military and its operations are essential for maintaining our national security.\n",
      "Let's talk about the quarter and performance. In <ORG>, we saw a strong third quarter demand for seasonal lawn and garden tools, storage and organizational solutions at major retailers and home centers across North America and in Australia. Upon reopening in June, there was strong U.K. demand for our product offerings as well. Our <ORG> strategic initiative remains on track and includes implementing an integrated business intelligence system, supporting all of our <ORG> operations, rationalizing our distribution and manufacturing facilities, and investing in automation and e-commerce capabilities.\n",
      "Our <ORG> segment revenue declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter. Strong residential sectional garage door sales, later in the quarter, almost completely offset the reduction in sales seen in the first part of the quarter. Sales in our commercial door business increased slightly in the quarter compared to the prior year.\n",
      "Operations at <ORG> have continued uninterrupted and Q3 revenue exceeded the prior year. The anticipated second tranche of bookings related to the <ORG> MH60 Romeo foreign military sale program with India was funded and $49 million was booked to backlog in the quarter. <ORG> experienced some slowing from suppliers during Q3, which could slow certain customer deliveries and work performed in Q4.\n",
      "We also are announcing today that we're evaluating strategic alternatives for <ORG>, which we call <ORG>, which is a technical services subsidiary within our <ORG> segment, providing advanced simulation and analysis for <ORG> and <ORG>. <ORG>' core business focus is on defense electronic systems, products, and systems. We believe that <ORG> would benefit from being part of a parent organization that is more focused on government technical services.\n",
      "Additionally, we're cognizant of the government's Organizational Conflict of Interest called OCI standards, and believe that such a sale better aligns our businesses with those standards.\n",
      "<ORG> is well-run with a strong management team and annual revenues of approximately $30 million. The timing of this process is bolstered by <ORG>'s recent $119 million award from the <ORG>.\n",
      "This is an opportunity for us to provide incremental value to <ORG> shareholders, while also positioning <ORG> for enhanced growth with a suitable acquirer. We've already started the process to sell this business and we're working to get that done in the near future.\n",
      "Let's turn to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we continued to work on strengthening our balance sheet and positioning the company for future growth. In June, we issued an additional $150 million of senior notes as a tack-on to the 5.75% notes we issued in February 2020. We've now fully refinanced our $1 billion of 5.25% notes due in 2022 with 5.75% notes that have maturity in 2028. As a reminder, in January, we also extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2025 and expanded its borrowing capacity by $50 million to $400 million with an additional $100 million of availability through an accordion feature.\n",
      "We've established a solid foundation for growing the company and we have ample liquidity to weather any near-term effects of the pandemic and other market uncertainty, while continuing to invest in all of our businesses.\n",
      "Finally, earlier today, our Board authorized a $0.075 per share dividend payable on September 17, 2020 to shareholders of record on August 20, 2020. This marks the 36th consecutive quarterly dividend to shareholders, which has grown at an annualized compound rate of 17% since we initiated it in 2012.\n",
      "Let me turn it over to <PERSON> for a little closer look at some of the numbers. <PERSON>?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Thank you, <PERSON>. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter consolidated performance. Revenue increased 10% to $632 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $69 million, both in comparison to the prior year quarter. Normalized gross profit for the quarter was $165 million, increasing 6.8% over the prior-year quarter, while gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 26.1%.\n",
      "Third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses were $114 million including $1.6 million of charges related to the <ORG> strategic initiative. As a percentage of sale, SG&A, adjusted for the charges, decreased 280 basis points to 17.7%.\n",
      "Third quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $22 million or $0.50 per share compared to the prior-year period of $14 million or $0.33 per share. Excluding items that affect comparability from both periods, current quarter adjusted net income was $26 million or $0.59 a share compared to the prior year of $13 million or $0.31 per share.\n",
      "The effective tax rate, excluding items that affect comparability for the quarter, was 30.8% and year-to-date was 32.6%. Capital spending was $12 million in the third quarter, in line with prior year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $16 million for the third quarter.\n",
      "Regarding our segments, <ORG> third quarter revenue increased 20% to $329 million over the prior year quarter, driven by increased volume of 19%, propelled by customer demand for home improvement in North America and Australia, favorable price and mix of 1% and incremental revenue from the <ORG> acquisition was 2%, all partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. Organic growth was 18%.\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA was $37 million, increasing 55% from the prior year quarter due to the increased revenue as mentioned a moment ago, partially offset by increased tariffs and COVID-19 related costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3% compared to 8.8% in the prior year quarter. The <ORG> strategic initiative continues on plan and we expect to close our Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania and Falls City, Nebraska facilities by the end of the fiscal year.\n",
      "<ORG> third quarter revenue decreased 1% to $219 million over the prior year quarter due primarily to decreased volume of residential sectional garage door orders in April, which were down 18%, but then had subsequent recovery in May and June. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% to $39 million over the prior year quarter due to the benefits of general operating efficiency improvements, partially offset by the decrease in revenue and COVID-19 related inefficiencies and direct costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.9% in the quarter compared to 15.3% in the prior year quarter.\n",
      "<ORG> third quarter revenue increased 5% to $84 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased deliveries and volume of radar and communication systems. Adjusted EBITDA during the period was $4 million compared to the prior year quarter of $7 million impacted by mix and program inefficiencies on radar and communication systems, as well as increased bid and proposal costs. Year-to-date backlog as of June 30, 2020 was $350 million, a $19 million increase from Q2. And we expect to continue to build backlog in the fourth quarter. Corporate and unallocated expenses, excluding depreciation, were $11 million in the third quarter.\n",
      "Regarding our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2020, we had $72 million in cash and total debt outstanding of $1.13 billion resulting in a net debt position of $1.06 billion and debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 4.4 times as calculated based on our debt covenants. This reflects one full turn of deleveraging from the prior year period. Borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was $274 million, subject to certain loan covenants.\n",
      "Moving to our fourth quarter and full-year outlook. Like many other companies, last quarter, we withdrew our guidance because of the uncertainties arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. We now have a clear picture of the effects of the pandemic's impact for this year. As a result, we are reinstating guidance for fiscal 2020. We normally give guidance once a year and do not update that guidance during the year and we plan to return to that policy. However, given the continued uncertainty resulting resulting from COVID-19, we felt it was appropriate for us to provide an update as an exception in this instance.\n",
      "We are now providing guidance for the full year 2020 of approximately $2.3 billion in revenue and $270 million plus of adjusted EBITDA before unallocated expenses. Note that our overall guidance, even with the conservative Q4 outlook, is higher than our original guidance for the year of $250 million plus of adjusted EBITDA before unallocated expenses that we provided back in November. Further, our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes approximately $60 million for capital expenditures, $64 million for depreciation and amortization, $65 million for net interest expense and $45 million for unallocated expenses, with all of these remaining the same as originally communicated during our November 2019 earnings call.\n",
      "Now, I'll turn the call back over to <PERSON>\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Thanks, <PERSON>. <ORG>'s year-to-date performance is something we are all collectively very proud of. Considering how much we've achieved in just a few short years since we began this portfolio repositioning, it's especially gratifying. At the time we announced it, we discussed the opportunities for top-line growth and margin expansion through the realization of efficiencies during the integration process of all of our acquired companies. Further, we expect it to become stronger competitively by providing increased value to our customers in terms of our broader product offering, improved service levels, and enhanced efficiency. We continue to believe the diversity of our businesses, our emphasis on domestic manufacturing, and our focus on the leading brands provides a strong foundation for future growth. This quarter in particular brings into focus what our repositioned portfolio can accomplish and the potential upside of following our strategy.\n",
      "<ORG>'s performance has been excellent and we believe there is still considerable opportunity for improving the performance of our businesses. In addition, we remain committed to finding strategic acquisitions that expand and strengthen our product portfolio within our home markets. We're getting closer to our objective of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA leverage, our free cash flow has and will continue to improve and we expect to see our leverage to continue to decline further, as we execute our business plan.\n",
      "In closing, I'd like to thank our workforce, which has shown exceptional dedication and perseverance throughout this challenging period. We appreciate the importance of their work in order to deliver these excellent results.\n",
      "Operator, we'll take any questions.\n",
      "Questions and Answers:\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Good afternoon and congratulations on some terrific results.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Thank you, <PERSON>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Thanks, <PERSON>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Yeah. So I wanted to start obviously particularly in CPP, just outstanding demand. How do you -- I guess, how long do you think this can last and how do you position your products and brands to get more attention and to become repeat purchases and replacement purchases and what do you need to do with this increased focus on your products to fulfill the demand that's out there?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Well, I'll start by reminding you that we were having a very good year going into COVID and the strength of our brands, the demand for our product was already ahead of expectations and certainly ahead of last year going into this pandemic. The structural changes that we clearly are seeing of how people are purchasing the types of products that we provide is -- had been moving to a way far more deliberate e-commerce-supported model, and that includes web searching as well as brick and mortar retail and online purchasing. And our strategy has been, for some time, that we're going to be the leading brands and the best products in every product that we sell. That was the story around <ORG>, that was the story around us buying <ORG> and then fitting it into <ORG>. So the strategy was clearly working. What happened with the stay-at-home is things are accelerating. And there is clearly an economy that's functioning quite well even during this incredibly difficult time.\n",
      "It's not lost on us that we're at record unemployment, It's not lost on us that we're in a recession and yet our business trends are not only surviving, they're prospering. So that result of being at home we view as, it was working going into this, accelerating during it, and are -- the back-end of your question is what we've been doing in terms of investing in the business. The <ORG> strategic initiative that we had announced in November was about the future for the company about being able to expand our distribution capability, expand our product offerings. We are believers in brands, we're builders of brands, we've bought companies in every product category. We're at the early stages of what we view as the <ORG> growth initiative. And what you see in this quarter is clearly a very robust demand. At the same time, aside of operating efficiencies that were already in place, driving increased performance. So our plan going forward is to continue to do exactly what we have been doing in building the brands and supporting the best retailers, both brick and mortar and online for every product that we sell.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay, that's great, very helpful. And then, shifting over to <ORG>, the international is coming on and margins were a little late, I guess, in the quarter. How do you see -- is this year kind of the trough? Can we see some growth adjusting for the <ORG>, the potential strategic alternatives as you said? And so, how do you kind of look at the next 12 to 24 months on the <ORG> side?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Yeah. We've talked about for some time that the <ORG> business was bottoming. We view that process as having played out as we expected. <ORG> clearly has had an impact on timing of orders, but the demand for the core surveillance and reconnaissance products, particularly radar systems, we continue to see the backlog improving. We expect that to showcase itself in the fourth quarter. The sale of <ORG> is the conclusion of what's been a very nice piece of <ORG> and the story behind it is we bought it in 2005, we've built it up, the sale of it is really about three things. One, it allows us to focus on the core of what <ORG> does. It should be a margin improvement story prospectively for us and it will be a small but meaningful additional part of our deleveraging story. So it's a gain. It's a business that we have built and the harvesting of it is part of our broader strategy of continuing to grow the core of <ORG>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "<ORG>. Congrats again on the quarter.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "I appreciate it.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "Our next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Hey, good afternoon.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Hi, <PERSON>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Hi, <PERSON>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "So on <ORG>, the strength you're seeing there, can you give us a little more granularity on what products are leading that growth? I know, you've got a very diverse portfolio and you called out outdoor lawn and garden, but you've also got some indoor lines like ClosetMaid, that I assume would have also done well, given everyone's kind of cooped up indoors. So I was hoping you could give us some specific examples of some product lines that are kind of leading that growth.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Sure. So, you sort of hit it. We have seen growth in demand of -- in both lawn and garden and the home organization side. Home organization is a -- pretty much a do-it-yourself type item where people can buy the products either at a store or online and install it. Home and garden, of course, is something that's done mostly outside and we are seeing people using their time at home and the fact that they're not spending on other things such as travel or going to restaurants and investing in their homes. And generally speaking, our products are at price points that are affordable. They're not very large ticket items. And that's what's been driving some of that demand.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Got it. And could you talk about maybe the sequential trend in CPP? Maybe how that business performed in May and June, and maybe give us a sense of how trends and fill rates are quarter-to-date?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "We continue to see...\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "We continue to see trends improving. The stabilization had happened after the last time we spoke, which was late April, went into May, accelerated into the end of the quarter and continues into July. We expect this is going to continue: the market share gains of the products that we provide, the domestic manufacturingand distribution, and we've been talking for several years that this focus of ours on being able to support the biggest providers of all the products, it's clear that the supply chains are moving to domestically sourced product. We are the leading product, leading market share in every major product category that we sell and we're going to continue to invest in the brands to make sure that we get increased market share as we go forward.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Got it. And you saw a really nice rebound on the residential garage door side. I remember last quarter you called out some customer hesitancy on the retail side, individuals kind of didn't want to stand in line at major home centers. Do you think there has been more of a change in customer behavior since April or was it more like the dealer side that drove that growth?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "So, yes, correct. We saw a decline in April. Our orders in April were down 18%, mostly being driven by home centers, retail type sales, with some decline in the dealers. As we progressed into May, sales started to normalize on all those channels and then come June and into July, sales accelerated quite well. And the commercial side saw good and normal volume and sales through the entire period.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Got it. So across the board, kind of, dealer and retail did well in June.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Yes, June and continued into July.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "And we continue to see that trending up. The other point that I'll just make is the commercial side of the business is doing well. We bought <ORG>, we had talked about the ability to provide the rolling steel doors as part of the warehouse business that was going to grow. <ORG> was going to continue to go through a transformation. The security part of our business, we're the leading manufacturer of a series of security doors, which is called the Defender Series, continues to show growth. The civil unrest that's going on around the country has actually spurred a level of demand in that business. The <ORG> business was already the leading residential manufacturer. Owning <ORG> gives us a leverage and we're at the early days of the integration of that business, obviously very gratifying to see the recovery from April residentially into May and it's, in our view, a reflection of the stay-at-home trends that are gone.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <ORG> -- Analyst\n",
      "Great. Very nice job, everyone. I'll hop back in the queue.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "We appreciate it, thanks.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Thanks, OK.\n",
      "Operator\n",
      "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from <PERSON> of <ORG>. Please go ahead.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <PERSON> -- Analyst\n",
      "Hey, gentlemen, good afternoon. Nice job.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Thanks, <PERSON>.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Thanks, <PERSON>. How are you doing?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <PERSON> -- Analyst\n",
      "Good, good, thanks. I guess my first question, just curious on channel inventory, particularly in <ORG>. How would you characterize that relative to normal? We're hearing some of the categories are pretty tight just in terms of the level of demand, kind of, in May and June and into July. So I'm just curious how you'd characterize some of your partners' channel inventories within your categories?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "I think that...\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "So we have actually -- I didn't mean to speak over you, so we have actually seen good demand for our products as we've already discussed. We have been able to service our customers very well. Our domestic manufacturing capability has really benefited us compared to others. So when major home centers need products, we are able to provide it to them or when any other home center or retail are needed. So we have adequate inventory and adequate manufacturing capability to continue to provide those products.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "I think...\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <PERSON> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "I think, in general, the inventory levels that we're seeing across -- and remember we service all of the major retailers from <ORG> to Loweâs to <ORG>, the national hardware chains, the mass retailers. This is a trend that we continue to see that they're ordering more.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <PERSON> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay. Okay. And then as you think of the strategic initiatives, could you just talk about kind of where you're at on the process there and just has the pandemic, through the quarter, had any impact on the timing or are you guys ahead or kind of on track there?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "I think we're...\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "We continue to be on track. It's a three-year plan. Things are going on as planned, on budget, on time. Nothing has slowed down from the pandemic.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <PERSON> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay, great. And then the free cash flow performance in the quarter was really good. How should we think about free cash flow maybe in the fourth quarter? Should you also have a pretty good quarter, just given the demand strength you've seen?\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "Yes. So, our second half of the year, that's our Q3 that we just ended, and our Q4 is our strongest cash flow months, cash generation quarters, I should say. And we continue to expect to increase cash flow into the fourth quarter.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- <PERSON> -- Analyst\n",
      "Okay. Great. Nice work on the quarter and good luck on the rest of the year, guys.\n",
      "<PERSON> -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "Thanks, <PERSON>.\n",
